# Team Profile Generator
Team Profile Generator is a node package demonstration. It begins with the user being prompted for input in the command line. It outputs html to the browser, which renders the template literal html code via a function call (Handlebars workaround). The application uses javascript constructor functions to create and store user input objects. Test files for constructor functions included. 

## Deployed
This is a command line program so it is not deployed. Download the files, install your node packages, and then run (node app.js) to begin user input prompt. Output view to web browser.
